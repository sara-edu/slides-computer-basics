## Inside a perosnal computer

All PCs have in common is a core set of components:

-   The computer ***`hardware`***: physical parts of your computer you can see and touch.

-   Computer ***`software`***: the programs and applications you run on your computer

## The Motherboard

> Home to Almost Everything

Computer chips and circuit boards are connected to a big circuit called a ***`motherboard`***

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Computer-motherboard.jpg)

## Microprocessor:
> The main engine

:::

::::

:::::

The specific chip that controls your entire computer system is buried on the motherboard. This chip is called a *microprocessor* or a *central processing unit (`CPU`)*. 

- Its speed today is measured in *`gigahertz`* (*GHz*)

## Computer memory

> Temporary storage

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Swissbit_2GB_PC2-5300U-555.jpg/2880px-Swissbit_2GB_PC2-5300U-555.jpg)

Your instructions to computer are temporarily held in the computer's random access memory (`RAM`).

-   The more memory that's available in a machine, the more instructions and data that can be stored at one time.

-   You can add extra memory

## Computer memory

Memory is measure in terms of `bytes`.

- one thousand *bytes* (1,024, to be exact) = a *kilobyte (KB)*

- one thousand kilobytes (1,024, to be exact) = a *megabyte (MB)*

- one thousand megabytes= a *gigabyte (GB)*

-   most computers come today with 4GB memory.


## Hard Disk Drives

> Long-term storage

It permanently stores all your important data. It can store multiple *terabytes* (*TB*) of data.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg/1920px-Laptop-hard-drive-exposed.jpg)

::: callout-warning
- If you try to reformat your hard disk, you will erase all the programs and data that have installed on your computer -- SO DO NOT DO IT!
:::

## Solid-State Drives (SSD)

> Faster Long-Term Storage

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/2023_Dysk_SSD_Patriot_P210_2TB.jpg/1920px-2023_Dysk_SSD_Patriot_P210_2TB.jpg)

-   This type of storage is much faster than traditional hard disk storage

-   `SSD` is little more expensive than hard disk.

## Keyboards:

Computers receive data by reading it from disk, through modem or receiving input directly from you, the user.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/LenovoKeyboard.jpg)

-   An `input device`, the most common input device you use to talk to your computer is the keyboard.

## Mice and Touchpads

> Point and click input devices

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![Mouse](images/mouse.png)

![Touchpad](images/touchpad.png)
:::

## Network Connections

> Getting connected

-   A network enables you to share files between multiple computers, as well as connect multiple PCs to a single printer or scanner.

-   To share broadband internet connection to that all your computers connect to the internet.

-   You can connect computers via either wired or wireless networks. Connecting a wireless network is as easy as buying a wireless router.

## Sound cards and speakers

> Making noise

All speaker systems are driven by a sound card or chip that is installed inside your system unit.

![](images/speakers.png)

## Video cards and monitors:

> Getting the picture

-   Computer monitors today are built around `LCD` (Liquid-crystal display) displays, just like you have on your living room TV.

-   Most monitors today come with a widescreen display that has the same 16:9 (or 16:10) aspect ratio used to display widescreen movies.

-   `Resolution` refers to the size of the images that can be displayed onscreen and is measured in pixels. A `pixel` is a single dot on your screen; a full picture is composed of thousands of pixels.

    -   Most external monitors today can display 1920-1080 or higher resolution (called full high definition, or `FHD`).

## Other parts of your computer

Other devices connect using a special type of cable called a *`USB`* (Universal Serial Bus) cable. All computers have multiple USB connections (sometimes called *`ports`*).

<br>

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Usb_connectors.JPG)

## Printers 

To make hard copy of documents and pictures, also includes copying, scanning, and even faxing capability.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/HP_Laserjet_5_DN_1.jpg)

## Webcams 

Small cameras to send live video

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Logicool_StreamCam_%28cropped%29.jpg/1920px-Logicool_StreamCam_%28cropped%29.jpg)

## Joysticks and game pads

To play the most challenging computer games.

:::

## External storage 

Just like the hard disk or solid state drives inside your computer, but they connect externally to help you back up your precious data.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/WD_External_Hard_Drives_IMG_7899.jpg/2560px-WD_External_Hard_Drives_IMG_7899.jpg)

## Software and Apps

-   Computer `software` is something you cannot touch because it is nothing more than a bunch of electronic bits and bytes.

-   These bits and bytes combine into computer programs also called `applications` or just `apps`.

-   You need a separate software for each task you want to do with your computer.

    -   for calculation = `spreadsheet` or excel
    -   for writing a letter = `word processing` program
    -   change pics or videos = `photo-editing` software
    -   to surf internet = need a `web browser`

## Make everything work with OS

[Files, <br> Folders, and <br> Online Storage]{#sec-folders .r-fit-text .right}

## Working with Files, Folders, & Online Storage

- Managing the data stored on your computer is vital. 

- After you save a file, you might need to copy it to another computer, move it to a new location on your hard drive, rename it, or even delete it. 

- You have to know how to perform all these operations—which means learning how to work with files, folders, and disks in Windows.

## Understanding Files and Folders

- All the information on your computer is stored in `files`. 

- A file is nothing more than a collection of digital data. 

- The contents of a file can be a document (such as a Word memo or an Excel spreadsheet), a digital photo or music track, or the executable code for a software program.

## Understanding Files and Folders

- Every file has a name.

- Each filename must consist of two parts, separated by a period (`.`) 
  - the `name` (to the left of the period) and
  - the `extension` (to the right of the period)
  
- A filename can consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and characters and looks something like this: `filename.ext`  

## Understanding Files and Folders

<br>

:::: {.columns}

![](https://www.tenforums.com/geek/gars/images/2/types/thumb_14486407500Folder.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
- Windows stores files in `folders`.

- A folder is like a parent file; each folder can contain both files and additional folders.

- The exact location of a file is called its `path` and contains all the folders leading to the file.
:::

::::

## Understanding Files and Folders

For example, a file named `ajay_cv.doc` that exists in the system folder, which is itself contained in the windows folder on your C: drive, has a path that looks like this: `C:\users\yourname\documents\ajay_cv.doc`.

::: {.callout-tip}
- By default, Windows hides the extensions when it displays filenames. To display extensions in Windows 11, select View, Show, File Name Extensions.
:::

## Using File Explorer

- In Windows 11, all the items stored on your computer -- including programs, documents, and configuring settings -- are accessible from `File Explorer`.

- You use File Explorer to find, copy, delete, and launch programs and documents.

## Launching File Explorer

You can launch File Explorer in one of four ways:

1. From the taskbar, click or tap the File Explorer icon.

1. Click or tap the `Start` button to display the Start menu; then click or tap the `File Explorer` icon.

1. Right-click the `Start` menu to display the Options menu; then click or tap File Explorer.

1. Press `Windows+E` on your computer keyboard.

## File Explorer Window

- `Quick Access:` your most recent used folders, as well as several folders that are "pinned" to this section: Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Pictures, and Videos.

- `OneDrive` section: it lets your folders stored on Microsoft's OneDrive Internet-based storage service.

- Below` This PC` section provides access to all the disk drives and devices connected to your computer.

- `Network` section: to access all your networked computers.

## Display File Contents & Details

To display the Details or the Preview pane, select `View` and then select either Details `Pane` or `Preview Pane`.

![](images/detail-pane.png)

## Navigate the Folders on Your PC

> A subfolder is a folder that is contained within another folder. Multiple subfolders can be nested in this fashion.

- To view the contents of a disk or folder, `double-click` or double-tap the selected item.

- To move back to the disk or folder previously selected, click the Back button (left arrow) in the Path bar beneath the toolbar.

- To choose from the history of disks and folders previously viewed, click the down arrow in the Address box in the Path bar and select a disk or folder.

## Viewing Files and Folders

::::

## Sorting Files and Folders

- To do this, click or tap `Sort` in the toolbar and then select `Group By`. 

- You can then choose to sort by a variety of criteria, including 
  - Name (if you want your file alphabetical), 
  - Date Modified, 
  - Type (to see all similar files together), 
  - Size, 
  - Date Created, 
  - Folder Path, 
  - Authors, 
  - Categories, or 
  - Title.

## Grouping Files and Folders

- You can also configure File Explorer to group the files in your folder, which can make it easier to identify particular files. 

- For example, if you sort your files by time and date modified, they’re grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, Last Week, and so on). 

- If you sort your files by type, they’re grouped by file extension, and so on.

## Searching for Files

- To use the Instant Search feature, enter one or more keywords into the `Search box` in the Path bar. Matching files display as you type; you can select one of these or finish entering the keyword(s) and then press Enter. 

- File Explorer displays a list of items that match your search criteria. Double-click or double-tap any icon to open that file.

## File and Folder Operations

Use the functions availabe on the File Explorer toolbar.

![](images/toolbar.png)

## Creating New Folders

The more files you create, the harder it is to organize and find things on your hard disk. 

To create a new folder, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the drive or folder where you want to place the new folder.

1. On the toolbar, select New, Folder.

1. A new, empty folder appears within the File Explorer window, with the filename New Folder highlighted.

1. Type a name for your folder (which overwrites the New Folder name), and press Enter.

## Naming New Folders

::: {.callout-warning}

- Folder and filenames can include up to 255 characters—including many special characters. Some special characters, however, are “illegal,” meaning that you can’t use them in folder or filenames. `Illegal characters` include the following: `\ / : * ? “ < > |`.

- The one part of the filename `you should never change is the extension`—the part that comes after the “dot.” That’s because Windows and other software programs recognize different types of program files and documents by their extension. This is why, by default, Windows hides these file extensions—so you can’t change them by mistake.

:::

## Renaming Files and Folders

When you create a new file or folder, it helps to give it a name that somehow describes its contents. 

To rename a file (or folder), follow these steps:

1. Click or tap the file or folder you want to rename.

1. Click or tap the Rename button on the toolbar.

1. Type a new name for your file or folder (which overwrites the current name), and press Enter.

## Copying Files

Copying a file lets you re-create that file in a different location, either on your computer’s hard drive or on some sort of external media. Here’s how to do it:

1. Select the item you want to copy.

1. Click or tap the Copy button on the toolbar.

1. Navigate to the folder where you want to copy the item.

1. Click or tap the Paste button on the toolbar.

## Moving (Cut and Paste) Files

- Moving a file (or folder) is different from copying it. Moving cuts the item from one location and pastes it into a new location. Copying leaves the item in its original location and creates a copy of the item elsewhere.

- In other words, when you copy something, you end up with two of it. When you move something, you have only the one instance.

To move a file, follow these steps:

1. Select the item you want to move.

1. Click or tap the Cut button on the toolbar.

1. Navigate to the new location where you want to move the item.

1. Click or tap the Paste button.

## Deleting Files

- Too many files eat up too much hard disk space—which is a bad thing because you have only so much disk space. Deleting a file is as easy as following these simple steps:

1. Select the file or files you want to delete. (To select multiple files, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking or tapping.)

1. Click or tap the Delete button on the toolbar.

This simple operation sends the file to the Windows Recycle Bin

::: {.callout-tip}
- You can also delete a file by selecting it and then pressing the Delete key on your computer keyboard.

The most popular type of portable drive today is the `USB` drive (sometimes called a pen drive or flash drive or thumb drive).
:::

::::

## How to use USB:

1. Insert the device into an open USB port on your computer. 

1. After you insert it, the drive appears as a new drive in the `This PC` section of the File Explorer navigation pane. 

1. Double-click or double-tap the USB drive icon to view the contents of the drive.

1. Then copy and paste files from your hard drive to the USB drive and vice versa. 

When you finish copying files, just remove the USB device (`Eject` safely).

## Copying Files via Email {{< fa envelope >}}

- You can send any file as an email `attachment`; a file is literally attached to an email message. 

- When the message is sent, the recipient can open or save the attached file when reading the message.

## Work with Cloud-Based Storage

- Microsoft offers online storage for all your documents and data, via its `OneDrive` service. When you store your files on OneDrive, you can access them via any computer or mobile device connected to the Internet.

- This type of online file storage is called `cloud storage` because the files are stored on the "cloud" of computers on the internet.

- It’s all up to you, and all available to any person with a web browser, password permission and an Internet connection.

## Access OneDrive from File Explorer

From within File Explorer, click or tap OneDrive in the navigation pane. This displays all your OneDrive files and folders.

- Microsoft gives you 5GB of storage in your free OneDrive account

## Sync Files on Your PC to OneDrive

To synchronize a file in this fashion, it must be stored in a special OneDrive folder. Then, whenever you connect to the Internet, any changes you make to that file are automatically made to the version of that file stored on OneDrive.

::: {.callout-note}
`Microsoft OneDrive` is just one of many cloud storage services you can use to store and share your files online. Other popular services include `Apple iCloud` (www.icloud.com), `Box` (www.box.com), `Dropbox` (www.dropbox.com), and `Google Drive` (www.google.com/drive/). All these services work in a similar fashion. Check out the various services before you commit—especially for a paid plan.
